# Iris Flower Classification using Random Forest
# Overview
The Iris flower dataset is a classic machine learning dataset that consists of measurements of different species of Iris flowers. In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on the provided features.

# Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project were:

Load and preprocess the Iris dataset, handling any missing values and encoding the target variable.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a Random Forest Classifier model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
Visualize the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance on each Iris species.

# Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:

* `pandas`: for data manipulation and analysis
* `sklearn`: for machine learning algorithms, evaluation metrics, and preprocessing
* `matplotlib`: for data visualization
The code is organized in a Jupyter Notebook and can be found in the iris-flower-classification.ipynb file.

# Results
After loading and preprocessing the Iris dataset, I split it into training and testing sets. I then trained a Random Forest Classifier model on the training data and evaluated its performance on the test set.

The model achieved an accuracy of 97.78% on the test set, which is a very good performance. The classification report provides more detailed insights, showing that the model has excellent precision, recall, and F1-score for all three Iris species.

To further understand the model's performance, I created a confusion matrix visualization. The confusion matrix shows that the model correctly classified the majority of the Iris flowers, with only a few misclassifications between the Iris species.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm, to classify Iris flowers into their respective species. The model's high accuracy and detailed performance metrics indicate that it can be a reliable tool for Iris flower classification tasks.
